            This trip, like majority of ours, was a spontaneous one. One halloween evening, we were disappointed after finding nothing of great interest at the Temple of Oculus Anubis (I'll let you look that one up for yourself), so we did the only logical thing: drive several hours out to the central Oregon desert at midnight to check out ghost towns. While this trip was originally only as far north as the ghost towns and ended at the Cove of Palisades, a few of our favorite nearby destinations have been added to extended the trip.

            This trip runs through fascinating historical and natural landmarks alike across the central Oregon desert, a high desert that acts as a surprising contrast in one of the greenest and rainiest states in the US. Perhaps unsurprisngly there are plenty of lakes, rivers and waterfalls to discover even here, each of which bring bursts of vibrant greenery to the land and make the central desert seem less of a wasteland and more a series of loosely connected oases.

            This trip starts up North just over the Washington border at Maryhill. Although this destination is more of a highlight for skaters than anyone else, it's still worth checking out if you don't mind the extra hour drive. Next is White River Falls, a spot that's beauty is only matched by its explorability. Following this is a historical journey through some of Oregon's ghost towns on the way down to the Cove of Palisades, the big green gem of the desert. Anyone who's managed to get this far in a reasonable amount time and is considering spending more time exploring the cove as well as Smith Rock State Park, this is a fantastic place to camp for the night.
