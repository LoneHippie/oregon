            In it's original form, this trip was improvised on the way back from the coastal 101 trip. We had just finished blasting down highway 101 all the way to the Redwood forest and quickly realized that we'd only taken 2 of the 3-4 days we'd given ourselves to finish the trip, so exploring a new forest that was more or less on the way back seemed like an obvious choice. As magic as the Oregon coast was, this improvised trip ended up being the highlight.

            The Umpqua forest has a kind of quiet beauty about it. You can drive for hours with little signs of civilization, and the sounds of traffic and city life are replaced by the constant rush of white rivers and waterfalls, roaring quietly in the background like giants hidden amongst the old-growth trees. The abundance of water and greenery make this trip perfect for any season: summers may lead to easier hiking experiences but also greatly change the appearance of several waterfalls, while winters often shroud the forest with blankets of fog and let you see the waterfalls at their fullest (just be prepared to get very wet and very muddy). There are cheap campgrounds all around the hikes on this trip, so we recommend taking your time. Just be sure to pack for rain.

            This trip starts up North with two impressive back to back waterfalls before heading south to the where the meat of the trip really starts. You'll go through a series of short but rewarding hikes, each ending with breath taking waterfalls that all seem in competition with each other for the title of most beautiful. At the end of this trip you'll have the chance to relax from all your hiking at Umpqua Hot Springs, the prettiest natural hot springs in the Pacific North West, if not the entire United States.
