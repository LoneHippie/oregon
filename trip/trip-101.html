            This trip might seem like a complete package; however, it originally came about as part of a trip from the top of Washington's highway 101 all the way down to the Redwood forest (a trip that we also highly recommend), but this leg of the trip will definitely give you the most bang for your buck.
        </p>
        <p class="intro-text">
            The Oregon coast (as well as the rest of the PNW coast) is unlike any other. Light gray sands act as bedding for the many massive seastacks, tidepools, and natural sanctuaries. Strange geological events have left the coast battered and beautifully disformed, and the ocean feels quiet, cold and brutal. While you're not likely to enjoy much swimming or surfing on these beaches, you'll never forget the sight of them.
        </p>
        <p class="intro-text">
            This trip starts at the only "tourist" destination we figured worth listing, Haystack Rock - a monolithic wildlife sanctuary jutting out of the sea that travellers can approach the base of on foot. A bit further down the coast we have, surprise surprise, another massive waterfall. Going further down, you'll come across the beautifully terrifying Devils Punchbowl and Thor's Well before reaching Cape Arago and Bandon Beach, two fantastic spots with tons of natures and small trails to explore. Finally, a quiet drive through the lonely Cape Blanco brings travellers to the coast's southernmost gem, the Natural Bridges. It's encouraged to take your time on this trip and fully explore any additional trails that might catch your attention, so for any multi-day trip keep in mind that highway 101 is littered with camping spots and hotels.
