# Oregon Hikes

An interactive website that acts as a pseudo blog for curated hikes, destinations and roadtrips around the Pacfic Northwest - mainly Oregon.

## Project Goals and Feautures

This website aims to show off the best the PNW has to offer in terms of natural beauty and outdoor experiences.
The original scope of the project was to allow users to not only view/sort hikes, but also create their own road trips by adding multiple hikes together which would create a route in Google maps. This part was scrapped as it required paid use of the Google maps API.
