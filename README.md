# Oregon Hikes

An interactive website that acts as a pseudo blog for curated hikes, destinations and roadtrips around the Pacfic Northwest - mainly Oregon.

## Project Goals and Feautures

This website aims to show off the best the PNW has to offer in terms of natural beauty and outdoor experiences.
The original scope of the project was to allow users to not only view/sort hikes, but also create their own road trips by adding multiple hikes together which would create a route in Google maps. This part was scrapped as it required paid use of the Google maps API. While this feature didn't make it to production, users can still sort hikes on a given page based on difficulty, duration or desired features (waterfalls, lakes, rivers, etc).

## What I Learned

This project helped solidify my understanding of CSS, file structure and linking between multiple files to build a larger multiple page project, and greatly advanced my understanding of Javascript. Most of the HTML for this website is generated by instances of a hike class, which is then insterted into the page. Throughout the creation of this website I found that I was writing custom solutions to problems that many JS frameworks such as React exist to address, and that I was stretching the practical limits of vanilla Javascript for a website such as this. Because of this project I gained a greater understanding of why frameworks exist and what problems they exist to solve.
